# Changelog

All notable changes to the alumi news project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed (critical — post-6.0 stabilization)
- **Massive duplicate cleanup** — deleted 14 duplicate articles across fusobacterium (4), GLP-1/Ozempic (3), PFAS (3), chlorpyrifos (2), Y-chromosome (1), cholesterol (1). Archived matching DB records
- **Hard programmatic duplicate filter** — `isDuplicate()` checks >40% word overlap with ALL existing articles + queue before ANY candidate reaches the editor. Not AI judgment — code
- **Writer restored to JSON output** — the raw HTML experiment broke tags, categories, and metadata. Reverted to original JSON format (html + metadata + svg + toc). Sonnet 4.6 handles it within timeout
- **Tags were sentence fragments** — "A national Swedish", "Semaglutide was associated" — now proper tags from Sonnet's JSON
- **`researchData is not defined`** — blocked ALL publishes. The `replacesSlug` feature referenced a variable that didn't exist in `stageQCAndPublish`
- **`safeStage` rollback loops** — failed writes rolled back to `editor_approved`, causing infinite write→timeout→rollback→write. Now fails hard, no rollback
- **Category leaked editor reasoning** — editor's rationale stored as category string. Now sanitized against 9-value whitelist
- **Scout and produce blocking each other** — global active guard blocked scout when produce was running. Now independent
- **Gemini findings not parseable** — Gemini returns grounded text, not JSON. Two-model scout: Gemini discovers, Sonnet structures

### Added
- **Two-model scout** — Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google Search) discovers 10 topics across recent + landmark timeframes. Sonnet 4.6 structures the best 5 into candidates
- **Full off-limits list** — Gemini now sees ALL article titles + queue topics (was truncated to 20, missing 49 articles)
- **Category balance in scout** — underserved categories (Nutrition, Fitness, Sleep Science) explicitly prioritized, oversaturated categories flagged
- **Featured rotation upgrade** — twice daily (12h), quality-gated (must have illustration, score >30), weighted by editor score (25%), recency (30%), independence score (15%), category diversity (10%)
- **Admin kill button** + `kill-article` edge function action
- **Hard duplicate filter** on queue inserts — same `isDuplicate()` check

### Changed
- **Scout frequency** — designed to run less often with bigger sweeps (10 topics per run vs 3)
- **Produce cron** — every 3 min (was 5)
- **QC defaults to publish** — only revises for serious factual errors, max 1 revision
- **Models**: Sonnet 4.6 (research/editor/write/QC), Gemini 2.5 Flash (scout discovery), Grok 3 (independence review)

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-23

### Architecture — Two-Job AI Newsroom
- **Scout job** (cron: `*/15`) — Gemini discovers topics via Google Search, Sonnet structures and scores, editor picks winner, unchosen auto-save to queue
- **Produce job** (cron: `*/3`) — editor picks from queue, self-chains: Editor Brief → Write (JSON) → Grok Independence Review → QC + Publish
- **Self-chaining** — each production stage triggers the next via HTTP POST. Cron is just the initial trigger
- **Topic queue** — `topic_queue` table. Admin can add manually. Scout auto-fills. Hard dedup prevents duplicates
- **`safeStage()` wrapper** — catches all errors, fails hard, records in log
- **Robust JSON parser** — proper brace-matching, truncated JSON repair
- **135s API timeout** — prevents Edge Function silent kills
- **`sortOrder`** (epoch ms) — newest articles always first
- **Schema columns** — `stage_started_at`, `model_used`, `grok_score`, `editor_score`, `revision_count`, `source`, `independence_score`, `pipeline_log_id`
- **Category sanitization** — whitelist of 9 valid categories
- **Pipeline Monitor** — 5-stage visualization, model badges, topic queue, kill buttons, independence scores

## [5.19.0] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **Daily article agent → staged pipeline** — broke monolithic pipeline (research + write + illustrate + publish) into 3 independent stages that each complete within Edge Function timeout limits. Each cron invocation processes ONE stage of ONE article
- **Cron schedule: daily → every 15 minutes** — with staged pipeline, one article takes ~45 min (3 stages x 15 min intervals). Capacity: ~32 articles/day. Temporary ramp-up until 100 articles reached
- **Rate limit: per-day → per-hour** — allows multiple articles per day instead of one

### Added
- **Smart featured rotation** — after each article publish, scores all articles on recency (40%), category diversity (20%), illustration quality (20%), read time (10%), and engagement proxy (10%). Auto-rotates featured article every 24h. Prevents stale featured stories
- **Auto-stop at 100 articles** — pipeline self-disables once article count reaches 100
- **Stale run cleanup** — automatically marks timed-out pipeline runs as failed, preventing zombie entries from blocking new runs
- **Concurrent execution guard** — prevents overlapping pipeline stages from running simultaneously
- **`research_data` column** on `daily_article_log` — stores research JSON between pipeline stages

### Fixed
- **Pipeline timeout crashes** — old monolithic pipeline (~4 min total) exceeded Edge Function wall clock limits. Staged approach keeps each invocation under 2 min

## [5.18.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Newsletter API not saving in production** — `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_URL` were missing from Vercel env vars. Set via CLI. Verified: emails now save to `newsletter_subscribers` table in production
- **OG image URLs relative instead of absolute** — social platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) cannot resolve relative paths. Now prepends site URL when image doesn't start with `http`
- **manifest.json wrong branding** — still said "Tune Health" instead of "alumi news"
- **robots.txt wrong sitemap URL** — pointed to nonexistent `tunehealth.com` domain. Corrected to `tune-health.vercel.app/sitemap-index.xml`
- **Double search icon on iPhone** — `.nav-inner button { display: flex }` in touch media query was overriding Tailwind's `hidden` class on the ⌘K trigger button. Removed the display override

### Removed
- **Article reactions system** — localStorage-only emoji counters that displayed personal clicks as "counts," appearing as social proof with no backend aggregation. Replaced with nothing — a serious magazine doesn't need fake engagement metrics

### Changed
- **All animations slowed 25%** — Tailwind duration scale overridden (200→250ms, 300→375ms, 500→625ms, 700→875ms), all raw CSS durations scaled proportionally. View Transitions, reveals, cards, SideNav, buttons all feel smoother
- **Grain texture tightened** — noise overlay `baseFrequency` 0.65 → 0.78 (~20% finer grain)
- **Vanity stats removed** — article counts, category counts, and "Est. 2024" removed from homepage hero, footer, articles index, and subscribe page. Subscribe page stats replaced with reader-relevant "Weekly / Free / Zero Sponsors"
- **Subscribe page** — wired to real `/api/subscribe` endpoint (was fake setTimeout)

## [5.17.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Stale header state after View Transition** — `updateScroll()` now called immediately on init to clear leftover `.scrolled` / `.header-hidden` classes from the previous page
- **HighlightShare listener leak** — added AbortController cleanup; `selectionchange`, `scroll`, and `mousedown` listeners were stacking on every page navigation
- **FloatingShareBar listener leak + duplicate logic** — replaced dual IntersectionObserver + scroll listener with single AbortController-managed scroll listener
- **Missing site assets** — favicon.svg, apple-touch-icon.png, og-image.png, and logo.png were referenced in BaseLayout and SEO.astro but didn't exist in `/public/assets/`. All now present
- **Newsletter API failing as static endpoint** — added `export const prerender = false` and try/catch around `request.json()` parsing

### Added
- **Supabase migration for newsletter_subscribers** — `20260323_newsletter_subscribers.sql` creates table with email unique constraint, RLS enabled, applied to production

## [5.16.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Sticky header hide/show on scroll** — on article pages (desktop), header slides up when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up (like Medium/Substack). Maximizes reading real estate. 8px dead zone prevents jitter
- **View Transition anti-flash CSS** — custom `::view-transition-old(root)` / `::view-transition-new(root)` keyframes with 200ms cross-fade prevent the white flash that occurred between page navigations
- **FloatingTOC keyboard accessibility** — added `:focus-visible` ring on TOC links and mobile pill text truncation (`max-width: 180px` with ellipsis) to prevent overflow on narrow screens
- **404 page noindex** — `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` prevents search engines from indexing error pages

### Fixed
- **Event listener memory leak across all nav components** — Header, SideNav, MobileNav, FloatingTOC, and BaseLayout core interactions now use `AbortController` to clean up old event listeners before re-attaching on View Transitions. Previously, every page navigation stacked duplicate listeners (N listeners after N navigations)
- **Header menu close race condition** — added `isHovering` state guard so rapid hover→leave→hover cycles no longer cause unpredictable menu state. Close timeout increased from 150ms to 250ms to match CSS transition
- **MobileNav scroll jitter on iOS** — added 8px dead zone to scroll delta detection, preventing momentum scroll oscillation from rapidly toggling the nav bar visibility
- **CommandPalette scroll lock** — body scroll now locked (`overflow: hidden`) when palette is open, preventing background page from scrolling behind the modal backdrop
- **CommandPalette backdrop click** — fixed click event bubbling by checking `e.target === e.currentTarget` instead of always closing on backdrop click
- **SideNav active link matching** — rewrote matching logic to properly handle query params and hash fragments. Added `aria-label` for accessibility
- **Subscribe page fake newsletter handler** — replaced `setTimeout` mock with real `/api/subscribe` API call with error handling
- **Subscribe page hardcoded stats** — "46+" articles and "7" categories now dynamically pulled from content collection

### Changed
- **Header transition refined** — replaced `transition-all duration-300` (caused white flash during View Transitions) with targeted `transition: border-color 0.15s, transform 0.3s`. Only the properties that need to animate now animate
- **All nav transitions optimized** — replaced 15+ `transition-all` usages with specific property transitions (background-color, box-shadow, opacity, transform) across cards, buttons, SideNav links, back-to-top. Eliminates unnecessary property watching and reduces visual jank
- **Menu dropdown shadow** — upgraded from generic `shadow-2xl` to editorial-quality custom shadow with directional depth (`0 20px 60px`)
- **SideNav stagger timing** — reduced logo delay from 100ms to 50ms, scroll delay from 150ms to 100ms for snappier feel

## [5.15.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Content-Security-Policy header** — CSP in `vercel.json` restricts scripts, styles, fonts, images, and connections to known origins (self, Google Fonts, Supabase, Unsplash). Blocks framing entirely
- **Newsletter API endpoint** (`/api/subscribe`) — server-side endpoint that validates email and upserts to Supabase `newsletter_subscribers` table. Falls back gracefully if Supabase is not configured
- **Article reactions tooltip** — "Reactions are saved locally on this device" note under reactions bar, setting correct user expectations

### Fixed
- **Newsletter form was fake** — both `Newsletter.astro` and homepage form used `setTimeout` to fake "Subscribed!" without saving data. Both now call `/api/subscribe` with proper error handling and feedback
- **Article search had no debounce** — articles index search input now debounces with 150ms delay instead of filtering on every keystroke
- **Dead sorting in `getArticlesForHomepage()`** — removed no-op `.sort()` that sorted by own index (preserving existing order). Function now simply concatenates published + coming-soon articles

## [5.14.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **HighlightShare popup visibility** — increased background opacity from 0.92 to 0.95 and enhanced shadow contrast for better visibility against both light and dark article content
- **MobileNav hardcoded colors** — replaced raw RGB values (`rgb(120 113 108)`, `rgb(220 38 38)`) with Tailwind `theme()` tokens (`stone.500`, `primary.600`, etc.) for proper design system integration
- **Drop cap color hardcoded** — replaced `#dc2626` / `#f87171` hex values with `theme('colors.primary.600')` / `theme('colors.primary.400')` for design system consistency
- **View Transitions ignore reduced-motion** — added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable article page transition animations for users who prefer reduced motion

### Changed
- **Font loading optimized** — added `preload` hint for Inter (critical UI font) to reduce render-blocking time

## [5.13.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`truncate()` utility** in `articles.ts` — replaces 7+ copy-pasted `.slice(0, N) + '...'` patterns across Header, Footer, SideNav
- **`MenuDropdownContent.astro`** — shared dropdown menu content extracted from Header, eliminating ~100 lines of duplicated markup between home and article variants
- **`twitter:site` meta tag** — `@aluminews` handle added to Twitter Card meta for proper attribution on social shares

### Fixed
- **Homepage Deep Dives were hardcoded** — 3 static "Coming Soon" cards with Unsplash images replaced with collection-driven published series from `getAllSeries()`. Published Thyroid Deep Dive now actually appears on homepage
- **Back-to-top button touch target** — increased from 40px (`w-10`) to 48px (`w-12`) for WCAG-compliant touch target
- **Duplicate `id="newsletter"` on homepage** — Newsletter component and homepage section both used same ID. Renamed homepage wrapper to `newsletter-section`
- **Mobile nav scroll jank** — added `will-change: transform` to `.mobile-nav` for GPU-accelerated scroll hide/show

### Changed
- **Header refactored** — dropdown menu markup extracted to `MenuDropdownContent.astro`, eliminating full duplication between home and article variants. Both variants now share identical menu content

## [5.12.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **SEO structured data domain mismatch** — `SEO.astro` was generating all JSON-LD schemas (Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, Article) pointing to `alumi-news.vercel.app` instead of `tune-health.vercel.app`. Now uses `Astro.site` for correct domain resolution
- **Duplicate Footer and CommandPaletteWrapper** on reading list page — `reading-list.astro` rendered Footer and CommandPaletteWrapper twice, producing double footers
- **Article schema missing `image` field** — Google rich results require an `image` property on Article schema. Added `ImageObject` with `heroImage` URL and alt text to structured data
- **Type safety gap in article utilities** — `mapArticle()` used `data: any` instead of `CollectionEntry<'articles'>`, losing all type checking on the most-used function in the codebase
- **Missing robots meta tag** — Added explicit `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">` to `BaseLayout.astro` as defensive SEO measure

## [5.11.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Mobile bottom navigation bar** (`MobileNav.astro`) — fixed 5-item nav (Home, Articles, Search, Saved, Series) for touch devices under 1024px. Active state highlighting, auto-hides on scroll down, safe-area-aware, hidden in print
- **"More in [Category]" link** on article pages — browse-category CTA below related articles for easy topic exploration
- **Active state indicators** in Header menu — highlights current section (Home, Articles, Deep Dives, Subscribe)
- **SideNav on article pages** — readers can now access sidebar navigation from any article (previously missing)
- **SideNav on Reading List page** — was missing Footer, CommandPalette, and SideNav
- **Deep Dives anchor IDs** — published series sections have slugified IDs for direct linking

### Fixed
- **3 dead topic links** — Header and SideNav hardcoded `?topic=sleep`, `?topic=hormones`, `?topic=supplements` which matched no real categories. All topic links now dynamically generated from `getCategories()` across Header, SideNav, and Footer
- **2 missing categories** — Clinical Evidence (10 articles) and Environmental Health (4 articles) were absent from Header and SideNav topic lists. Now auto-populated
- **Header article links could 404** — "Latest" section used raw `article.id` (with `.json` extension) instead of mapped `article.href`. Fixed to use `getArticles()` utility
- **SideNav series links pointed to nonexistent anchors** — 5 hardcoded coming-soon series linked to `#habit-formation`, `#microbiome`, etc. which had no matching IDs on the Deep Dives page. Replaced with dynamic published series from `getAllSeries()`, linking to first article of each series
- **Homepage category counter hardcoded "7"** — now uses dynamic `{categories.length}` (actual count: 9)
- **Article pages were a navigation dead end** — article variant Header only showed Home/Articles/Series text links with no menu dropdown. Now includes full dropdown menu with sections + topics
- **No outside-click close on Header menu** — touch devices got stuck with menu open. Added document click listener
- **Reading List page used stripped Header variant** — changed to home variant with full menu access

### Changed
- **Header** — refactored from `getCollection('articles')` to `getArticles()` + `getCategories()` utilities for consistency. Article variant now has full dropdown menu matching home variant
- **SideNav** — topics and series sections are now fully collection-driven (were hardcoded). Series links to first article with "All Deep Dives" link. Topics pulled from `getCategories()`
- **BaseLayout** — imports and renders `MobileNav` component on all pages
- **Back-to-top button** — repositioned above mobile nav on touch devices
- **Footer padding** — adjusted on touch devices to not be hidden behind mobile nav

## [5.10.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Expanded social sharing** (`ShareButtons.astro`) — now supports 8 platforms: X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Reddit, Bluesky, WhatsApp, Email (mailto with prefilled body), and copy link. Each platform icon highlights in its brand color on hover. Reddit and Bluesky hidden on small screens to prevent overflow
- **Native Web Share API** — on mobile devices, a "More" share button taps into the OS share sheet (Messages, AirDrop, etc.). Only renders when `navigator.share` is available
- **Floating share sidebar** (`FloatingShareBar.astro`) — sticky vertical share bar fixed to the left edge of article pages on xl+ screens. Glass morphism styling, appears when article content is in view, hides at footer
- **Article reactions** (`ArticleReactions.astro`) — emoji reaction bar (Insightful, Mind-blown, Rigorous, Practical) with localStorage persistence per article slug. Pop animation on click, toggle on/off, count display
- **Highlight-to-share** (`HighlightShare.astro`) — when users select 10–400 characters of article text, a dark tooltip popup appears with options to share the quote on X, Bluesky, or copy with attribution. Only triggers within article content
- **Reading List page** (`/reading-list`) — full page for viewing all bookmarked articles from localStorage. Shows article cards with hero images, category, read time. Per-article remove button + "Clear all" with confirmation. Empty state with CTA
- **Social follow links in Footer** — RSS, X/Twitter, and Bluesky follow buttons with hover-lift effect in a new "Follow & Subscribe" section
- **RSS autodiscovery** — `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` in BaseLayout `<head>` so feed readers auto-detect the RSS feed
- **Reading List + RSS links in SideNav** — bookmark icon link to `/reading-list` and RSS icon link to `/rss.xml` in the sidebar "More" section

### Fixed
- **Share URL domain** — ShareButtons now uses correct `tune-health.vercel.app` via `Astro.site` (was hardcoded to `aluminews.com`)
- **Package version sync** — bumped from 5.8.0 to 5.10.0 to match changelog

### Changed
- **ShareButtons** supports `variant` prop (`"inline"` | `"vertical"`) and `description` prop for richer share text
- **ArticleLayout** now includes FloatingShareBar, ArticleReactions, and HighlightShare components
- **Footer** has new social/follow section above the bottom bar
- **SideNav** "More" section expanded with Reading List and RSS Feed links

## [5.9.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **RSS feed** (`/rss.xml`) — via `@astrojs/rss`, includes all published articles with tags as categories
- **Sitemap** — `@astrojs/sitemap` integration generates `sitemap-index.xml` on build
- **Custom 404 page** — branded error page with "Back to Home" and "Browse Articles" CTAs
- **About page** (`/about`) — mission statement, editorial standards, brand tone cards, app CTA. Linked from Footer and SideNav
- **Series infrastructure** — `series` and `seriesOrder` fields in content schema, `getSeriesArticles()` and `getAllSeries()` utility functions
- **Series navigation component** (`SeriesNav.astro`) — progress dots, "Part X of Y" counter, prev/next links. Auto-renders on articles with a `series` field
- **Social share buttons** (`ShareButtons.astro`) — Twitter, LinkedIn, copy link on every article page
- **Breadcrumbs** on article pages — Home > Articles > Category with topic link wiring
- **Bookmark / reading list** (`BookmarkButton.astro`) — localStorage-based save system on article pages
- **Article pagination** — articles index shows 12 initially with "Show More" button; auto-expands when filtering or searching
- **Per-article OG images** — `heroImage` from Supabase used as Open Graph image for social sharing

### Fixed
- **Canonical URL mismatch** — `siteUrl` corrected from `alumi-news.vercel.app` to `tune-health.vercel.app` in BaseLayout. All OG tags, canonical links, and Twitter cards now point to the correct domain
- **Topic nav links were dead** — 16+ links from Header/SideNav/Footer to `/articles?topic=X` now work. Articles index reads `?topic=` URL param and auto-selects matching category chip
- **Related articles were random** — `getRelatedArticles()` now scores by category match (+10) and shared tag overlap (+3 each) instead of returning first 3 articles
- **Fake social proof removed** — subscribe page no longer claims fabricated subscriber counts, open rates, or quotes a fictional doctor. Replaced with honest article stats
- **Homepage category filter inconsistency** — featured hero card now respects category filter (hidden when category doesn't match)
- **Package version mismatch** — package.json synced from 5.5.0 to 5.8.0 (now 5.9.0)
- **Newsletter form duplication** — homepage form now uses shared `data-newsletter-form` pattern; removed duplicate inline handler

### Changed
- **Deep Dives page rewrite** — now dynamically renders published series (Thyroid Deep Dive, 6 articles with cards) above coming-soon series, using `getAllSeries()` from content collection
- **Thyroid articles** — all 6 articles tagged with `series: "The Thyroid Deep Dive"` and `seriesOrder: 1-6`
- **Article header navigation** — article pages now show Home / Articles / Series links instead of just a back arrow
- **Font loading optimized** — reduced from 22 font weights to 13 across 3 families (Playfair Display 8→5, Inter 5→4, Crimson Pro 7→3)
- **Loader speed** — reduced forced delay from 1.6s to 0.6s
- **Footer nav** — added About link to Explore section
- **SideNav** — "Our Mission" link changed to About page link

### Removed
- **GSAP dependency** — unused (zero imports in src/), removed from package.json and astro.config.mjs

## [5.8.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Thyroid Series (Parts 2–6)** — 5 deep-dive articles published from source docs with AI-generated editorial illustrations:
  - **Part 2: "The War Within"** (`thyroid-war-within`) — Hashimoto's, Graves', gut-thyroid axis, molecular mimicry, selenium, microbiome signatures. 15 min read. Clinical Evidence.
  - **Part 3: "The Poisoned Well"** (`thyroid-poisoned-well`) — PFAS, fluoride, perchlorate, BPA, phthalates, pesticides, mixture toxicology, regulatory failure. 13 min read. Environmental Health.
  - **Part 4: "The Fetal Blueprint"** (`thyroid-fetal-blueprint`) — Maternal thyroid dependency, iodine deficiency resurgence, autism link (2x risk with uncontrolled hypothyroidism), IQ effects, universal screening failure. 11 min read. Clinical Evidence.
  - **Part 5: "The Cancer That Wasn't"** (`thyroid-cancer-conversation`) — Overdiagnosis paradox, active surveillance, thermal ablation, BRAF/RET/NTRK molecular targeting, 2025 ATA guidelines. 11 min read. Clinical Evidence.
  - **Part 6: "Rebuilding the Thyroid"** (`thyroid-rebuilding`) — IMITHOT FMT trial, AI-assisted diagnostics, polygenic risk scores, DIO2-guided T3 therapy, precision medicine vision for 2035. 12 min read. Clinical Evidence.
- Total published articles: 46

### Fixed
- **Production URL** — README updated from stale `alumi-news.vercel.app` to correct `tune-health.vercel.app`

## [5.7.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Daily Article Agent** (`daily-article-agent` Edge Function) — fully autonomous daily editorial pipeline
  - **Phase 1: Research** — Claude with native `web_search_20250305` tool autonomously discovers trending health topics from the last 3 days (up to 10 web searches), cross-referenced against existing article catalog to avoid duplicates. No third-party search API needed.
  - **Phase 2: Article Writing** — Claude with web search (up to 5 fact-checking searches) writes a 2,500-3,000+ word investigative article with full editorial formatting (sections, pull quotes, info cards, SVG hero, TOC, disclaimer)
  - **Phase 3: Publish** — saves to Supabase DB, commits .astro + .json to GitHub (triggers Vercel deploy), fires illustration generation
  - Actions: `run` (full pipeline), `dry-run` (everything except GitHub publish), `status` (recent log entries)
  - Rate-limited: one successful run per calendar day
  - Supports `model` parameter: defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.6 for speed, accepts `"opus"` for Claude Opus 4.6 quality
- **`daily_article_log` table** — tracks each agent run: topic, slug, title, status, error, search queries, research snippets, timestamps
- **`pg_cron` schedule** — daily at 6 AM UTC via `pg_net` HTTP POST to Edge Function
- **New article: "The Shingles Shot That Quietly Became a Heart Drug"** — investigative article on the ACC.26 study showing 46% MACE reduction from shingles vaccination, Korean cohort (1.27M participants), ESC meta-analysis, VZV vascular damage mechanisms, dementia protection evidence, and skeptics' assessment. 13-minute read, Clinical Evidence category.
### Fixed
- **Illustration pipeline sync** — daily agent was committing article JSON to GitHub *before* illustration was generated (fire-and-forget), so heroImage never reached the static site. Now waits for illustration generation (up to 60s), gets the URL, and includes `heroImage`/`heroImageAlt` in the GitHub commit. Articles deploy with art from the first build.
- **Large article card (01) missing title** — `.article-card-large` image had `lg:h-full` which filled the entire card, pushing `.article-card-content` out of view via `overflow-hidden`. Fixed with magazine-style overlay: content sits on top of the image with a gradient, scoped to `lg+` only (mobile keeps stacked layout).
- **Newsletter input iOS auto-zoom** — `text-sm` (14px) → `text-base` (16px) to prevent Safari zoom on focus.

### Changed
- **UI tightening across the site** — reduced visual bloat for a more refined, magazine-like density:
  - **Typography**: display-1 max 6rem→4.5rem, heading-1 3.5rem→2.75rem, heading-2 2.25rem→1.875rem, body-lg and overline slightly reduced
  - **Container**: max-width 1400px→1240px, padding px-6/8/12→px-5/8/10
  - **Nav**: height h-18/h-20→h-14/h-16
  - **Hero**: full viewport (100dvh), stats + scroll indicator absolute-anchored at bottom
  - **Section padding**: py-20/py-28→py-14/py-20, mission py-24/py-32→py-16/py-24
  - **Cards**: content padding p-5/p-6→p-4/p-5, image aspect 16/10→16/9, featured image 4/5→4/3, featured card rounded-3xl→rounded-2xl
  - **Buttons**: px-6 py-3→px-5 py-2.5
  - **Card numbers**: opacity 15%→10%, sizes reduced one step throughout
  - **Deep dives hero**: tightened padding

### Architecture
- Daily article agent pipeline: Claude with native `web_search` tool → autonomous topic discovery & research → article writing with fact-checking → DB save → GitHub publish → illustration generation. No third-party search API — uses Anthropic's built-in server-side web search.
- `pg_cron` + `pg_net` extensions for scheduled execution (must be enabled in Supabase Dashboard)
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260322_daily_article_agent.sql`

## [5.6.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Funnel expansion** — 3 additional touchpoints from quality audit:
  - **Command Palette**: "Open alumi Health" action (power users, ⌘K)
  - **Subscribe page**: app cross-promo card after "Recent Issues" sidebar
  - **Deep Dives page**: "Apply What You Learn" bridge section between series list and newsletter
  - **Articles index**: compact "Take Your Learning Further" CTA section above newsletter

### Fixed
- **AppPromo section background** — added `bg-white dark:bg-stone-900` so the homepage app section visually separates from surrounding sections (was blending into default background)
- **ArticleCTA touch target** — added `min-h-[44px]` to CTA button for WCAG AA compliance on touch devices

## [5.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **alumi Health funnel system** — 5 touchpoints connecting the editorial magazine to the alumi Health app (`https://tune-sigma.vercel.app`)
  - **Article-end CTA** (`ArticleCTA.astro`): contextual per category — maps article topics to relevant app features (e.g., Longevity → Lab Results, Nutrition → Meal Analysis, Neuroscience → AI Analyst). Appears after every article's author card
  - **Homepage section** (`AppPromo.astro`): 4-feature grid (Lab Results, Meal Analysis, AI Analyst, N=1 Experiments) with "Start 14-Day Free Trial" CTA, placed between the Mission section and Deep Dives
  - **Header nav link**: subtle pill-shaped "alumi Health" link with external arrow, hidden on mobile to keep header clean
  - **Footer section**: alumi Health promo bar with description and "Start Free Trial" button, placed above the copyright bar
  - **SideNav promo card**: compact app card in the sidebar under a new "App" section label
- **Funnel configuration module** (`src/utils/funnel.ts`): centralized category-to-feature mapping, CTA copy, and UTM link builder — single source of truth for all 5 touchpoints
- **UTM tracking**: every app link includes `utm_source=alumi-news`, `utm_medium={touchpoint}`, `utm_campaign={category}`, `utm_content={article-slug}` for conversion tracking
- **CSS**: `.app-cta`, `.app-cta-icon`, `.app-cta-feature-pill`, `.app-promo-card` styles in `@layer components`

## [5.5.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Drop cap baseline alignment** — replaced manual `float-left` + hardcoded `font-size`/`margin-top`/`margin-bottom` with CSS `initial-letter: 3` (+ `-webkit-initial-letter` for Safari), which automatically sizes and aligns the drop cap to span exactly 3 text lines with proper baseline alignment. Moved rule outside `@layer components` to prevent cascade layer from suppressing `initial-letter`. Float fallback (`font-size: 6.1rem`) for browsers without support. Fixed selector to `> section:first-child > p:first-of-type` so only the article's opening paragraph gets a drop cap (was applying to every section's first paragraph).

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Security
- **Auth added to `delete-article` and `publish-article` Edge Functions** — both were previously unauthenticated, allowing anyone to delete or publish articles. Now require `ADMIN_TOKEN` Bearer auth.
- **Auth bypass fixed in `articles-api`** — logic `if (adminToken && ...)` allowed write ops when `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var was unset. Changed to `if (!adminToken || ...)`.
- **Error info leakage fixed** — all 8 Edge Functions now return generic error messages instead of raw `err.message` (which could expose internal details like DB errors, API rate limits)
- **Admin token env var renamed** — `PUBLIC_ADMIN_TOKEN` → `ADMIN_TOKEN` (server-side only). The `PUBLIC_` prefix was exposing the token in client-side Astro bundles.
- **Security headers** — added `vercel.json` with X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy

### Added
- **AI Agents panel** on admin dashboard (replaces minimal "AI Tools" section):
  - **Editorial QC Agent**: 3 modes (Audit Only, Dry Run preview, Audit & Auto-Fix), severity selector (High/Medium+/All), pattern warnings, copy report to clipboard, per-issue fix status with check/skip/error indicators, status badge showing grade
  - **Illustration Agent**: single-article dropdown selector for targeted generation, batch controls (Generate Missing, Regenerate All with cost confirmation)
  - **Database Sync**: refresh DB from content button
- **Admin dashboard enhancements**: 6 stat cards (total, published, drafts, featured, illustrated, avg read time), category breakdown pill row, recently updated horizontal scroll, article search/filter, description preview per card, illustration status indicator (green/gray dot), tag count
- **Category gradient mapping** — added "Research Summary" and "Pharmacology" to `getArticleGradientStyle()` (were falling back to gray default)

### Fixed
- **iPhone scroll-back-up bug** — reveal animations used 700ms `translateY` transitions that fought with iOS Safari scroll momentum. On touch devices, transforms are now disabled — opacity-only transitions at 300ms. Removed negative `rootMargin` from IntersectionObserver. Removed `will-change: transform` from scroll progress bar.
- **iOS auto-zoom on inputs** — newsletter email input and admin form inputs were below 16px (iOS auto-zooms on < 16px). Changed to `text-base` / `1rem`.
- **Mobile menu scroll lock** — added `body.menu-open { overflow: hidden }` to prevent background scroll when hamburger menu is open
- **SideNav back-gesture conflict** — trigger zone moved 12px from left edge, hidden entirely on touch devices to avoid conflicting with iOS Safari back-swipe
- **Admin layout viewport units** — changed `100vh` to `100dvh` (3 instances) so layout doesn't extend behind iOS browser chrome
- **Scroll progress bar address bar** — now uses `visualViewport.height` instead of `innerHeight` to handle iOS address bar collapse/expand
- **Command Palette safe area** — respects `env(safe-area-inset-top)` for iPhone notch, added `px-4` edge padding
- **FloatingTOC touch target** — collapse button expands to 44px on touch devices (was 24px, below Apple minimum)
- **TypeScript errors** — fixed `slugify()` union type mismatch in ArticleEditor, reverted `mapArticle` data param to proper Astro type
- **Silent catch blocks** — 3 empty `catch {}` blocks in ArticleEditor now provide user feedback
- **`as any` casts eliminated** — added `Window` interface extension, proper type narrowing in CommandPalette, DraftData interface in ArticleEditor, typed `updateMetadata` parameter
- **`console.error` removed** from generate-illustration Edge Function (production code rule)

### Changed
- **Branding consistency** — BRAND.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json updated from "Tune Health" to "alumi news"
- **Package.json** — name `alumi-news`, version `5.5.0`, removed unused `@astrojs/node` dependency
- **`.nvmrc`** — updated from Node 20 to 22 (matches runtime)
- **Deprecated CSS removed** — `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` (unnecessary in modern iOS)
- **Reveal animation timing** — reduced from 700ms to 400ms on desktop, 300ms on mobile; stagger delays reduced proportionally

### Removed
- `astro-temp/` leftover scaffold directory (44KB, was gitignored but cluttering workspace)

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **AI Tools panel** on admin dashboard — live controls for Editorial QC and Illustration generation
  - "Audit Only" button: runs editorial-qc audit, shows grade + issues with before/after comparisons
  - "Audit & Fix" button: audits then auto-applies medium+ severity fixes
  - "Generate Missing" button: batch-generates illustrations for articles without them
  - "Regenerate All" button: regenerates all illustrations (with cost confirmation dialog)
  - 4th stat card showing illustration coverage (X/Y illustrated)
- **Auto-illustration on article creation** — ArticleEditor now calls `generate-illustration` automatically after Claude generates a new article

### Changed
- **14 headlines refined for brand voice** — replaced QC-generated titles that were too clickbaity with headlines matching the editorial voice (provocative + intellectual, not BuzzFeed)
  - "IQ Tests Are Mostly Bullshit" → "What IQ Actually Measures — and What It Misses Entirely"
  - "The Ovary Apocalypse" → "Half the Population Goes Through Menopause. Medicine Barely Noticed."
  - "Empathy Is Overrated" → "Empathy Has a Problem Science Is Only Now Admitting"

### Fixed
- **Title mismatch between cards and article pages** — all 39 `.astro` page files synced with JSON metadata titles. Previously, card titles (from JSON) were updated but article page titles (hardcoded in `.astro` props) still showed old values.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`editorial-qc` Edge Function** — autonomous editorial quality control system
  - `audit`: Claude (Sonnet) reviews ALL articles holistically as a collection, analyzing headline variety, reader magnetism, description quality, illustration status, and metadata completeness. Returns structured JSON report with issues, severity levels, specific suggestions, and an overall grade.
  - `fix`: Auto-applies changes by dispatching to other Edge Functions (`articles-api` for titles/descriptions, `generate-illustration` for missing art). Supports `min_severity` threshold and `dry_run` mode.
  - `audit-and-fix`: Combined flow — audit then auto-fix in one call.
  - Identifies patterns like structural repetition ("22/39 titles start with 'The'"), weak differentiation, and monotonous headline rhythms.
- All 39 articles seeded to Supabase database (was only 8)

### Changed
- **16 article titles improved** based on QC audit — reduced "The X" pattern from 56% to ~30%, increased structural variety, improved reader magnetism
- Examples: "The Disease Medicine Forgot" → "190 Million Women Have a Disease Science Ignores", "The Switching Brain: What Creativity Actually Is" → "Creativity Isn't What You Think It Is"

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`generate-illustration` Edge Function** — automated AI illustration pipeline using OpenAI GPT Image 1.5
  - `generate` action: creates an editorial illustration for a single article by slug
  - `batch` action: generates illustrations for all articles missing them (with `force` option)
  - House style prompt ensures consistent "premium health science magazine" visual language
  - Category-specific color palettes (8 categories) for cohesive art direction
  - Images stored in Supabase Storage (`article-illustrations` bucket)
  - Auto-updates `hero_image` and `hero_image_alt` in database
  - Rate-limit-safe sequential processing for batch operations
- **heroImage rendering with gradient fallback** — all card components now check for `heroImage` first, then fall back to category gradient art. This means illustrations automatically appear everywhere once generated.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` stored securely in Supabase secrets (never in code or .env)

### Architecture
- Image pipeline: OpenAI GPT Image 1.5 → Supabase Storage → database `hero_image` field → static site JSON → card rendering
- All secrets (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, ADMIN_TOKEN) stored in Supabase secrets only

## [5.1.0] - 2026-03-22

- `getArticleGradientStyle()` utility — maps categories to rich CSS gradient palettes (Mental Health = indigo/violet, Neuroscience = blue/cyan, Longevity = emerald/teal, etc.)
- `getCategories()` used in homepage and articles index for dynamic category rendering

### Fixed
- **Broken gradient rendering** — dynamic Tailwind classes (`from-${var}`) were being purged at build time, showing empty gray card images. Now uses real CSS via inline styles
- Removed `heroImage`/`heroImageAlt`/`sortOrder` fields from all article JSON files (unused, replaced by gradient art system)
