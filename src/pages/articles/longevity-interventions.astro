      <p>The most popular longevity interventions—from OMAD fasting to NAD+ supplements to fasting-mimicking diets—rest on a foundation far shakier than their proponents admit. While animal studies have generated extraordinary claims about reversing aging, the translation to humans has been marked by replication failures, null results, and a troubling pattern of conflicts of interest among the field's most prominent figures. <strong>Only exercise has robust human evidence</strong> for extending lifespan by 2-6 years; everything else ranges from "promising but unproven" to "actively disproven."</p>

      <h2>OMAD Claims Collide with Clinical Evidence Showing Adverse Effects</h2>

      <p>One Meal A Day (OMAD) eating has gained enormous popularity through social media, promoted for benefits including enhanced autophagy, accelerated fat loss, improved metabolic health, and even longevity. The reality in clinical research tells a starkly different story.</p>

      <p><strong>Only one controlled study</strong> has actually tested true OMAD eating. Published in 2007 by researchers at the USDA and National Institute on Aging, this randomized crossover trial put 21 normal-weight adults through eight weeks of eating one meal per day (consumed between 4-8pm) versus three meals daily at identical caloric intake. The results were concerning: participants showed <strong>significantly impaired morning glucose tolerance, elevated fasting blood glucose, increased LDL cholesterol and blood pressure</strong>, decreased hemoglobin and red blood cells, and a dropout rate of <strong>28.6%</strong>—four to seven times higher than typical feeding studies. The authors concluded that OMAD "worsens morning glucose tolerance compared to an isocaloric diet spread across three meals."</p>

      <p>A 2022 observational study added another warning: eating one meal per day was associated with <strong>increased risk of death from any cause and cardiovascular disease</strong>. While observational data cannot prove causation, combined with the controlled study's metabolic findings, the pattern is unfavorable.</p>

      <h4 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-400">Time-Restricted Eating: Key Trial Results</h4>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm">
        <li><strong>TREAT Trial (2020):</strong> No significant difference in weight loss between 16:8 eating and three structured meals</li>
        <li><strong>12-Month RCT (2022):</strong> No difference between TRE + caloric restriction vs. caloric restriction alone</li>
        <li><strong>Minnesota Trial (2025):</strong> No significant improvements in weight, body composition, or glycemic measures for TRE</li>
        <li><strong>Early TRE (7am-3pm):</strong> Modest advantages—6.3 kg vs 4.0 kg weight loss in UAB trial</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <section class="reveal">
      <p>When TRE shows benefits, <strong>timing matters more than fasting duration</strong>. Early time-restricted eating (eTRE)—eating from approximately 7am to 3pm—has demonstrated modest advantages. Multiple studies confirm glucose tolerance is higher in the morning than evening, and the same meal consumed at dinner produces higher glucose spikes than at breakfast. The popular practice of OMAD at dinner is <strong>metabolically backwards</strong> according to circadian research.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="autophagy" class="reveal">
      <h2>Autophagy Claims Rest Almost Entirely on Rodent Extrapolation</h2>

      <p>The claim that specific fasting durations trigger autophagy—cellular self-cleaning—in humans is among the most repeated and least substantiated in the fasting community. Proponents often cite 16-hour or 24-hour thresholds with scientific-sounding certainty. The evidence doesn't support such precision.</p>

      <p>Animal studies suggest autophagy begins <strong>24-48 hours</strong> into fasting, primarily in liver and immune cells. In humans, LC3-II (an autophagy marker) appears to rise after roughly 16 hours and peak around 24 hours—but this comes from very limited data in specific tissues. A 2022 intervention study in 50 women found that after eight weeks of intermittent fasting including 24-hour fasts, autophagy markers in muscle were actually <strong>decreased</strong>, likely as a response to weight loss rather than enhanced cellular cleanup.</p>

      <p>Cleveland Clinic's assessment is appropriately humble: "Studies involving animals suggest autophagy may begin between 24 to 48 hours of fasting. <strong>Not enough research has been collected on the ideal timing to trigger human autophagy.</strong>"</p>

      <p>Peter Attia, who previously practiced aggressive fasting protocols including 7-10 day water fasts quarterly, has publicly revised his position: "16 hours without food simply isn't long enough to activate autophagy." He ceased extended fasting in 2020 after losing <strong>10-20 pounds of lean mass</strong> over three years. His current classification of fasting: "fuzzy"—some benefits but difficult to measure cellular effects, with trade-offs against muscle preservation.</p>

      <h2>The Primate Studies Disagreed for Methodological Reasons</h2>

      <p>The two landmark rhesus monkey caloric restriction studies—from the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (started 1989) and the National Institute on Aging (started 1987)—initially appeared to reach contradictory conclusions. Wisconsin found CR delayed disease and mortality; NIA found no significant survival effect.</p>

      <p>A 2017 reconciliation analysis published in Nature Communications revealed the answer wasn't biological contradiction but <strong>methodological differences</strong>:</p>
    </section>

    <div class="info-card my-12 reveal">
      <h4 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-400">Why the Primate Studies Disagreed</h4>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Age at onset:</strong> Wisconsin started CR only in adult monkeys (ages 7-14); NIA included young and older animals. CR appears beneficial in adult primates but <em>not beneficial for younger animals</em></li>
        <li><strong>Diet composition:</strong> Wisconsin fed a semi-purified diet high in sucrose (~28.5%); NIA used naturally-sourced foods. Wisconsin's control monkeys were eating "junk food"</li>
        <li><strong>Control group feeding:</strong> Wisconsin controls ate ad libitum (unlimited); NIA controls were fed according to standardized charts—effectively slightly calorie-restricted themselves</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <section class="reveal">
      <p>When data from both studies were pooled, the conclusion emerged: caloric restriction does delay aging in nonhuman primates, but effects depend heavily on age of onset, diet quality, sex, and genetic background. The lesson isn't that one study was right and one wrong—it's that CR effects are <strong>highly conditional</strong>, not a universal longevity lever.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="calerie" class="reveal">
      <h2>CALERIE Trials Show Metabolic Benefits but No Lifespan Proof</h2>

      <p>The CALERIE Phase 2 trial represents the most rigorous human test of caloric restriction: 218 participants (145 CR, 75 control) aged 21-50, with normal to slightly overweight BMI, followed for 24 months. The target was 25% CR, but participants could only sustain <strong>11.9% on average</strong>—revealing a fundamental sustainability problem.</p>

      <p>Results showed genuine cardiometabolic improvements: significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and improved insulin sensitivity. The CR group lost 7.6 kg versus 0.4 kg gained by controls. A DNA methylation analysis suggested a <strong>2-3% slowing in the "pace of aging"</strong>, estimated to translate to 10-15% reduced mortality risk—comparable to smoking cessation. Yale researchers found the CR group showed thymus rejuvenation, producing more T cells after two years.</p>

      <p>The adverse effects were real: <strong>bone mineral density declined 1.8-2.2%</strong> at clinically important fracture sites (lumbar spine, hip, femoral neck). One participant was withdrawn for excessive bone loss; two others temporarily discontinued. Thirty percent of lost weight was lean body mass.</p>

      <p>Critically, CALERIE cannot and does not prove CR extends human lifespan. That would require following participants for 50+ years. What we have are biomarker improvements and epigenetic signatures. Whether these translate to actual years of life remains <strong>unknown and perhaps unknowable</strong> within practical research timelines.</p>

      <p>"Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan."</p>
    </aside>

    <section class="reveal">
      <p>An October 2024 Nature study on 960 genetically diverse mice delivered a sobering finding: <strong>genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction</strong>. More troublingly, "metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan." The mice that looked healthiest by metabolic markers didn't necessarily live longest.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="rapamycin" class="reveal">
      <h2>Rapamycin Shows the Strongest Animal Evidence but Limited Human Data</h2>

      <p>Among pharmaceutical candidates, rapamycin stands alone in consistency. The NIA Interventions Testing Program—which tests compounds at three independent sites in genetically heterogeneous mice and publishes all results regardless of outcome—has found rapamycin extends lifespan <strong>9-14% even when started late in life</strong>, equivalent to roughly 60 human years. It remains the most consistently successful compound tested across ~35 agents evaluated.</p>

      <p>Human data is far more limited. The <strong>PEARL trial</strong>, published April 2025, was a 48-week randomized controlled trial of 114 participants around age 60 taking weekly rapamycin or placebo. The primary outcome (visceral fat reduction) showed <strong>no significant change</strong>. Women on 10mg showed improved lean tissue mass and self-reported pain; men showed improved bone mineral content. Critically, the compounded rapamycin used was discovered to be ~3.5x less bioavailable than commercial sirolimus.</p>

      <p>Earlier work by Joan Mannick found that low-dose mTOR inhibitors <strong>improved immune response</strong> in elderly adults—20% better response to influenza vaccination—contrary to rapamycin's reputation as an immunosuppressant.</p>

      <p>The verdict: rapamycin has the strongest animal evidence of any longevity drug but <strong>no evidence yet for human lifespan extension</strong>. Larger, longer trials with proper formulations are needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="metformin" class="reveal">
      <h2>Metformin's Observational Evidence Collapsed Under Scrutiny</h2>

      <p>The TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin), designed to definitively test metformin's anti-aging potential in 3,000 participants over six years, has FDA approval but <strong>remains unfunded</strong> despite years of effort. Estimated cost: $45-70 million; raised so far: approximately $16 million. As of late 2024, it has not started.</p>

      <p>This matters because the observational evidence that generated excitement has not held up. The widely-cited 2014 Bannister study found diabetics on metformin had 15% lower mortality than non-diabetics—a seemingly miraculous finding. But a 2023 Welsh study following 129,140 metformin patients for 20 years found the opposite: initial benefit in the first 3 years <strong>reversed after 5 years</strong>, and by 20 years, diabetics on metformin lived only ~80% as long as matched non-diabetics.</p>

      <p>The exercise blunting concern adds further uncertainty. The <strong>MASTERS trial</strong> found that healthy adults over 65 taking metformin while doing resistance training gained only <strong>0.41% lean mass</strong> versus <strong>1.95%</strong> for placebo—metformin blunted the muscle-building response. Aerobic exercise studies show similar patterns: 50% less improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, inhibited mitochondrial adaptations.</p>

      <p>For healthy exercising adults—the population most likely to pursue longevity interventions—metformin may <strong>subtract rather than add</strong> health benefits.</p>

    <section id="resveratrol" class="reveal">
      <h2>Resveratrol's Spectacular Failure Should Have Ended the Hype</h2>

      <p>The resveratrol story represents one of biotechnology's greatest cautionary tales. David Sinclair's lab reported that resveratrol activated SIRT1 enzymes and extended lifespan in yeast, worms, and obese mice. Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, founded in 2004, went public in 2007. GlaxoSmithKline acquired Sirtris in 2008 for <strong>$720 million</strong>.</p>

      <p>Then it fell apart. Studies by Pfizer (2010) and Amgen scientists revealed the apparent SIRT1 activation was a <strong>fluorescent artifact</strong>—resveratrol only appeared to work because of the fluorophore attached to the test substrate, not true enzyme activation. GSK's lead compound failed to lower glucose in diabetic mice; at high doses, it started killing them. A Phase IIa trial for multiple myeloma was suspended after patients developed kidney failure. By December 2010, all SRT501 development was terminated. In 2013, GSK shut down Sirtris entirely.</p>

      <p>Independent researchers published in 2011 that sirtuin genes <strong>do not extend lifespan in worms or flies</strong>—Sinclair's foundational claims could not be replicated. The NIA Interventions Testing Program found <strong>no lifespan extension</strong> from resveratrol in genetically heterogeneous mice at two different doses.</p>

      <p>At a 2025 longevity roundtable, when asked "Can we say anything positive about resveratrol?", researchers Steven Austad and Richard Miller both answered "No." When asked why resveratrol "doesn't die," Austad replied: "Money?"</p>

    <section id="nad" class="reveal">
      <h2>NAD+ Precursors Raise Blood Levels but Show Minimal Functional Benefits</h2>

      <p>NMN and NR (nicotinamide riboside) supplements <strong>do raise blood NAD+ levels</strong> in humans—this is consistently demonstrated. Whether this translates to meaningful anti-aging benefits is another question.</p>

      <p>A 2021 Washington University study found 250mg NMN for 10 weeks improved muscle insulin sensitivity by ~25% in 25 prediabetic, postmenopausal women. But the lead investigator cautioned: "It is premature to make any clinical recommendations." Many other trials show null results. A 2022 Frontiers in Aging study found <strong>no statistically significant changes in efficacy outcomes between active and placebo groups</strong> at 300mg NMN. A 2025 meta-analysis concluded: "Current evidence <strong>does not support NMN and NR supplementation for preserving muscle mass and function</strong> in adults with mean age over 60 years."</p>

      <p>NR faces similar limitations. What NR <strong>does not do</strong> per clinical evidence: increase muscle NAD+ directly, alter mitochondrial bioenergetics in aged muscle, improve insulin sensitivity or body composition in obese older men, or improve exercise endurance.</p>
    </section>

    <aside class="pull-quote reveal">
      <p>"Collectively, oral nicotinamide riboside supplementation has displayed few clinically relevant effects, and there is an unfortunate tendency in the literature to exaggerate the importance and robustness of reported effects."</p>
    </aside>

    <section class="reveal">
      <p>A 2024 study added a fundamental concern: most orally administered NMN and NR is <strong>converted to nicotinic acid by gut microbiota</strong> before entering systemic circulation—meaning they may not function as direct NAD+ precursors as claimed.</p>

    <section id="prolon" class="reveal">
      <h2>Valter Longo's ProLon Science Comes Almost Entirely from His Own Lab</h2>

      <p>Valter Longo founded L-Nutra, the company that sells ProLon (the branded fasting-mimicking diet product). He holds patents on the technology, has equity interest in L-Nutra, and his employer USC also owns equity and receives royalty payments. He claims to mitigate conflicts by donating 100% of consulting fees and at least 95% of L-Nutra shares to charity—but this doesn't eliminate conflicts when career, reputation, research funding, and philanthropic impact all depend on ProLon's success.</p>

      <p>The foundational 2017 trial in Science Translational Medicine randomized 100 subjects (71 completers) to three cycles of the five-day FMD monthly. Results showed modest weight loss (~5 lbs), reduced blood pressure, decreased IGF-1 and fasting glucose. Limitations: small sample, short duration (3 months), <strong>funded by USC/Longo's lab with L-Nutra-provided products</strong>.</p>

      <p>After extensive searching, virtually all published FMD studies involve either Longo as author/co-author, L-Nutra providing the product, or USC Longevity Institute. <strong>Truly independent replication of the key findings does not appear to exist</strong> in the published literature.</p>

      <p>ProLon costs <strong>$175-250 for a five-day kit</strong>, or $525-750 for the recommended three-month protocol. Whether it produces benefits beyond simply eating ~800 calories of low-protein food for five days—which would cost $0-50—is <strong>untested in head-to-head comparisons</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Worm-to-Human Translation Problem Is Even Worse Than Assumed</h2>

      <p>This translation gap exists because causes of death differ drastically: cancer accounts for 80-90% of deaths in mice, intestinal barrier dysfunction in Drosophila, pharynx pathology in C. elegans, and heart disease in humans. Drug metabolism, anatomy, and physiology all differ.</p>

      <p>The NIA ITP has tested approximately 35 compounds with transparent publication of all results. <strong>Most fail</strong>. Notable negative results: resveratrol (no effect), fisetin (no significant effect), metformin alone (no effect), fish oil (actually <strong>shortened lifespan</strong>), green tea extract (no effect), curcumin (no effect). Only rapamycin, acarbose, NDGA, aspirin, 17-α-estradiol, and glycine showed replicated lifespan extension—and four of six worked <strong>only in one sex</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Failed Interventions That Were Once Hyped</h2>

      <h3>Growth Hormone</h3>
      <p>Promoted as an anti-aging treatment based on a small 1990 study. A 2007 meta-analysis of 18 studies concluded: "GH cannot be recommended as an anti-aging therapy." Side effects included joint pain, edema, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Paradoxically, <strong>GH-deficient mice live longer</strong>—reduced GH may be protective.</p>

      <h3>Antioxidant Supplements</h3>
      <p>Promoted on the theory that oxidative damage causes aging. A Cochrane review of 78 trials with 296,707 participants found beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E <strong>increased mortality by 3-5%</strong>. Worse, antioxidants may block exercise benefits—vitamins C, E, resveratrol, and acetyl-N-cysteine have been shown to blunt exercise-induced improvements in glucose sensitivity.</p>

      <h3>Senolytics</h3>
      <p>Dasatinib + quercetin show early promise from small Mayo Clinic pilots demonstrating they can reduce senescent cell markers in humans. But Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 failed its Phase 2 trial for knee osteoarthritis—<strong>no statistically significant difference</strong> from placebo in 183 patients. The senolytic approach may yet prove valuable, but definitive human efficacy data doesn't exist.</p>

      <h2>Exercise Remains the Only Intervention with Solid Human Lifespan Evidence</h2>

      <p>While the longevity industry promotes pills, powders, and protocols, the intervention with actual human evidence for lifespan extension is exercise. Moderate aerobic exercise extends life expectancy by <strong>2-6 years</strong> in otherwise healthy adults. A CDC six-year study found three behaviors—not smoking, healthy diet, and 21+ minutes of moderate exercise daily—reduced mortality by <strong>82%</strong>.</p>

      <p>Dr. Eric Topol's assessment: "Skip the supplements and the cryotherapy: Experts say the best biohack for adding years to your life is exercise."</p>

      <p>The longevity supplement industry, valued in the billions, exists in the gap between what animal studies suggest and what human evidence confirms. That gap is vast, and the financial incentives to obscure it are substantial.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>The longevity field has a credibility problem rooted in systematic overstatement of preliminary findings. When <strong>92%</strong> of worm studies report positive results but only <strong>23%</strong> of those translate to mice—and the gap to humans is likely worse—the field is not operating with scientific humility. When prominent researchers hold equity in companies selling products they study, forced resignations over overblown claims, and $720 million acquisitions lead to complete shutdowns, the incentive structure has failed.</p>

      <p>What readers deserve is not despair but calibration. Some interventions are genuinely promising (rapamycin, senolytics) and deserve continued rigorous investigation. Some have failed definitively (resveratrol, growth hormone, antioxidant supplements) and should be abandoned. Many popular interventions (OMAD, NAD+ precursors, fasting-mimicking diets) rest on insufficient human evidence and conflicts of interest that readers should weigh.</p>

      <p>The most effective longevity intervention—exercise—is free, proven, and largely ignored by an industry selling complexity. Until human trials catch up to animal models, the honest answer to "what should I take for longevity?" remains: <strong>your running shoes</strong>.</p>
