> Health information is broken. Mainstream sources defer to authority and industry-funded research. Alternative health cherry-picks studies and sells false hope. Both sides have conflicts of interest they don't disclose.

We'll tell you when a cheap generic outperforms an expensive supplement, and when a folk remedy has more science behind it than a blockbuster medication. We follow evidence wherever it leads, even when it's inconvenient.

### Option B - Refined Sophistication

**Slogan:** "Where evidence leads, we follow"

**About Us:**
> Most health content falls into two camps: institutional voices that won't question the establishment, and alternative voices that won't question themselves. Both are selling something.
>
> Tune Health is different. We're not here to validate your existing beliefs or push a philosophy. We're here to find out what actually works.
>
> That means applying the same analytical rigor to a Harvard meta-analysis as we do to a supplement company's claims. It means acknowledging when conventional medicine gets it wrong, and when traditional remedies hold up to scrutiny. It means changing our minds when the evidence demands it.
>
> We have no sponsors to please and no tribe to protect. Just a relentless commitment to getting it right.
>
> *Health decisions are too important for bullshit.*

**Slogan:** "Evidence over allegiance"

**Tagline:** "Independent health analysis - no white coats, no gurus, no sponsors"

> Most health content falls into two camps: institutional voices that defer to authority, and alternative voices that reject it entirely. Both have conflicts of interest they don't disclose. Both are selling something.
>
> Tune Health is the filter.
>
> We apply the same rigorous skepticism to a pharmaceutical meta-analysis as we do to a supplement company's claims. We acknowledge when conventional medicine gets it wrong, and when traditional remedies hold up to scrutiny. We follow evidence wherever it leads - even when it's inconvenient for either tribe.
>
> No sponsors to please. No sacred cows. No tribe to protect.
>
> Just a relentless commitment to getting it right - because health decisions are too important for bullshit.
